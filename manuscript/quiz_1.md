# Markua Quiz test

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=VOCYL-FNbr0) of Peter explaining Markua.

? What year was that video from?

What year? Really? Did it really take that long? What was going on???

a) 2012
b) 2013
C) 2014
d) 2015

{words: 500}
? Why do you think the first version of the Markua spec took so long?

Look at the Leanpub website and read the [pricing essay](https://leanpub.com/pricing).

! Answers could include "bootstrapped startup", the spec evolving, removing HTML mapping, etc.

That's it for this quiz, and this MOOC!
