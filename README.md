# ITCR_Course_Template

This template includes all of the files that you need to get started creating your course in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) using the [bookdown package](https://bookdown.org/). This is useful as this package allows you to preview your course easily from RStudio and to eventually host a book on GitHub and Leanpub.

## Creating your course

As you modify the names of the chapters of your course and add more chapters (using the `.Rmd` files), you need to update the `_bookdown.yml` file accordingly.

For example let's say that we added another chapter and named the file `03-chapter_of_course.Rmd`. We would update our `_bookdown.yml` to look like this:

book_filename: "ITCR_Course_Name"  
chapter_name: "Chapter "  
repo: https://github.com/jhudsl/ITCR_Course_Template/ ##Make sure you update this for your GitHub Repo!!  
rmd_files: ["index.Rmd",  
            "01-intro.Rmd",   
            "02-chapter_of_course.Rmd",   
            "03-chapter_of_course.Rmd",  ##Only this is new!
            "about.Rmd"]  
new_session: yes  
delete_merged_file: true  
language:  
  ui:  
    chapter_name: "Chapter "  
output_dir: "docs"  

Notice how only one line is different - the one that says `03-chapter_of_course.Rmd",`
Be careful about quotation marks: `""` as well as commas: `,`!

Once we do this we can preview the book! 

You can do so by typing: 
`bookdown::serve_book()` in the RStudio Console.  

You will then see a live version of your book in your RStudio viewer. 

## Getting your course ready for Leanpub 

We also include the necessary files to allow you to get your course ready for publication on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/). These are located in the `manuscript` directory. When you are happy with your book using bookdown, then you just need to follow a few steps to copy the necessary files from your `docs` directory into the `manuscript` directory. The `docs` directory is auto-generated by the `bookdown` package.  You need to copy time `images` directory as well as the `.md` files. 

If you are comfortable using commands like the following, you can do this in a more automated way in the RStudio terminal:

cp docs/*.md manuscript  
cp -r docs/images/ manuscript/resources/images  



Finally you need to modify the `Book.txt` file in the `manuscript` directory to include the `.md` files that you wish in the order that you would like. We have also included a quiz example. If you wanted two quizzes (one called `quiz_1.md` and one called `quiz_2.md`) you could duplicate and modify `quiz_1.md` for your needs and then you could make the `Book.txt` file look like this (assuming you created a chapter called `"03-chapter_of_course.Rmd"` and you wanted quiz_1 to be after `02-chapter-of_course` and quiz_2 to be after `03_chapter_of_course`:  

01-intro.md  
02-chapter_of_course.md  
quiz_1.md  
03-chapter_of_course.md  
quiz_2.md  
about.md  


Note that any `.md` files with an `#` in front of the name in the `Book.txt` file will be ignored by Leanpub. We have included an example of this in the `Book.txt` file.
